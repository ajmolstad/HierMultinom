# Reproduce scRNA-seq analyses

**Note.** Please direct any questions to amolstad@umn.edu. 

In order to run the analyses, the processed Hao et al. (2021)  (hao\_2020\_truncated.RDS) data can be downloaded directly from 
[this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ppipv32xsl3sx4/hao_2020_truncated.rds?dl=1). 

The file mrMLR.rds is the estimated regression coefficient matrix from the first replicate with p = 2000 and n\_train = 20000. This is used to create the regression coefficient matrix image in Section 7. 

Running these analyses is both time and resource intensive. Currently one needs access to a high-performance computing system with long computing times (say, ~4-5 days). If you would like the complete results directly, please contact the first author at the email above.
